My third mini-project for the [Scrimba React Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact). Based on [this Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/MoLwFPHNHJVrzdFurxHzNV/Meme-Generator).

This interactive React app explores components with props, event listeners, conditional rendering, forms, state (useState) and side effects (useEffect).



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
